It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If you\u2019re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.Example Cards are built with as little markup and styles as possible, but still manage to deliver a ton of control and customization. Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other Bootstrap components. They have no margin by default, so use spacing utilities as needed.Below is an example of a basic card with mixed content and a fixed width. Cards have no fixed width to start, so they\u2019ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element. This is easily customized with our various sizing options.

Below are examples of what\u2019s supported.Body The building block of a card is the .card-body. Use it whenever you need a padded section within a card.            This is some text within a card body.            html                                                                                      <div class=\"card\">  <div class=\"card-body\">    This is some text within a card body.  </div></div>Titles, text, and links Card titles are used by adding .card-title to a <h*> tag. In the same way, links are added and placed next to each other by adding .card-link to an <a> tag.Subtitles are used by adding a .card-subtitle to a <h*> tag. If the .card-title and the .card-subtitle items are placed in a .card-body item, the card title and subtitle are aligned nicely.

In the example below, we remove the grid gutters with .g-0 and use .col-md-* classes to make the card horizontal at the md breakpoint.

For the time being, these layout options are not yet responsive.Card groups Use card groups to render cards as a single, attached element with equal width and height columns. Card groups start off stacked and use display: flex; to become attached with uniform dimensions starting at the sm breakpoint.

If you want to have this type of layout in v5, you can just make use of Masonry plugin. Masonry is not included in Bootstrap, but we\u2019ve made a demo example to help you get started.CSS Variables Added in v5.2.0As part of Bootstrap\u2019s evolving CSS variables approach, cards now use local CSS variables on .card for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.          scss/_card.scss                                          --#{$prefix}card-spacer-y: #{$card-spacer-y};--#{$prefix}card-spacer-x: #{$card-spacer-x};--#{$prefix}card-title-spacer-y: #{$card-title-spacer-y};--#{$prefix}card-title-color: #{$card-title-color};--#{$prefix}card-subtitle-color: #{$card-subtitle-color};--#{$prefix}card-border-width: #{$card-border-width};--#{$prefix}card-border-color: #{$card-border-color};--#{$prefix}card-border-radius: #{$card-border-radius};--#{$prefix}card-box-shadow: #{$card-box-shadow};--#{$prefix}card-inner-border-radius: #{$card-inner-border-radius};--#{$prefix}card-cap-padding-y: #{$card-cap-padding-y};--#{$prefix}card-cap-padding-x: #{$card-cap-padding-x};--#{$prefix}card-cap-bg: #{$card-cap-bg};--#{$prefix}card-cap-color: #{$card-cap-color};--#{$prefix}card-height: #{$card-height};--#{$prefix}card-color: #{$card-color};--#{$prefix}card-bg: #{$card-bg};--#{$prefix}card-img-overlay-padding: #{$card-img-overlay-padding};--#{$prefix}card-group-margin: #{$card-group-margin};Sass variables           scss/_variables.scss                                          $card-spacer-y:                     $spacer;$card-spacer-x:                     $spacer;$card-title-spacer-y:               $spacer * .5;$card-title-color:                  null;$card-subtitle-color:               null;$card-border-width:                 var(--#{$prefix}border-width);$card-border-color:                 var(--#{$prefix}border-color-translucent);$card-border-radius:                var(--#{$prefix}border-radius);$card-box-shadow:                   null;$card-inner-border-radius:          subtract($card-border-radius, $card-border-width);$card-cap-padding-y:                $card-spacer-y * .5;$card-cap-padding-x:                $card-spacer-x;$card-cap-bg:                       rgba(var(--#{$prefix}body-color-rgb), .03);$card-cap-color:                    null;$card-height:                       null;$card-color:                        null;$card-bg:                           var(--#{$prefix}body-bg);$card-img-overlay-padding:          $spacer;$card-group-margin:                 $grid-gutter-width * .5;"
