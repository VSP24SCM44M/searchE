Includes support for some of the more common values, as well as some extras for controlling display when printing.

We purposely support only a subset of all possible values for display. Classes can be combined for various effects as you need.Notation Display utility classes that apply to all breakpoints, from xs to xxl, have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those classes are applied from min-width: 0; and up, and thus are not bound by a media query. The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.As such, the classes are named using the format:.d-{value} for xs.d-{breakpoint}-{value} for sm, md, lg, xl, and xxl.Where value is one of:noneinlineinline-blockblockgridinline-gridtabletable-celltable-rowflexinline-flexThe display values can be altered by changing the display values defined in $utilities and recompiling the SCSS.The media queries affect screen widths with the given breakpoint or larger. For example, .d-lg-none sets display: none; on lg, xl, and xxl screens.Examples       d-inlined-inline          html                                                                                      <div class=\"d-inline p-2 text-bg-primary\">d-inline</div><div class=\"d-inline p-2 text-bg-dark\">d-inline</div>      d-blockd-block          html                                                                                      <span class=\"d-block p-2 text-bg-primary\">d-block</span><span class=\"d-block p-2 text-bg-dark\">d-block</span>Hiding elements For faster mobile-friendly development, use responsive display classes for showing and hiding elements by device. Avoid creating entirely different versions of the same site, instead hide elements responsively for each screen size.To hide elements simply use the .d-none class or one of the .d-{sm,md,lg,xl,xxl}-none classes for any responsive screen variation.To show an element only on a given interval of screen sizes you can combine one .d-*-none class with a .d-*-* class, for example .d-none .d-md-block .d-xl-none .d-xxl-none will hide the element for all screen sizes except on medium and large devices.Screen sizeClassHidden on all.d-noneHidden only on xs.d-none .d-sm-blockHidden only on sm.d-sm-none .d-md-blockHidden only on md.d-md-none .d-lg-blockHidden only on lg.d-lg-none .d-xl-blockHidden only on xl.d-xl-none .d-xxl-blockHidden only on xxl.d-xxl-noneVisible on all.d-blockVisible only on xs.d-block .d-sm-noneVisible only on sm.d-none .d-sm-block .d-md-noneVisible only on md.d-none .d-md-block .d-lg-noneVisible only on lg.d-none .d-lg-block .d-xl-noneVisible only on xl.d-none .d-xl-block .d-xxl-noneVisible only on xxl.d-none .d-xxl-block      hide on lg and wider screenshide on screens smaller than lg          html                                                                                      <div class=\"d-lg-none\">hide on lg and wider screens</div><div class=\"d-none d-lg-block\">hide on screens smaller than lg</div>Display in print Change the display value of elements when printing with our print display utility classes.
