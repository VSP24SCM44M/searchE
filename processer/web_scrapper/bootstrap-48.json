Using our Sass color-contrast() function, we automatically determine a contrasting color for a particular background-color.Heads up! There\u2019s currently no support for a CSS-native color-contrast function, so we use our own via Sass. This means that customizing our theme colors via CSS variables may cause color contrast issues with these utilities.

Please ensure the meaning is obvious from the content itself (e.g., the visible text with a sufficient color contrast) or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the .visually-hidden class.With components Use them in place of combined .text-* and .bg-* classes, like on badges:      PrimaryInfo          html                                                                                      <span class=\"badge text-bg-primary\">Primary</span><span class=\"badge text-bg-info\">Info</span>Or on cards:        Header      Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.
