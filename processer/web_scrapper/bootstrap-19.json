This property tells the content to fill the parent container in a variety of ways, such as preserving the aspect ratio or stretching to take up as much space as possible.Classes for the value of object-fit are named using the format .object-fit-{value}. Choose from the following values:containcoverfillscale (for scale-down)noneExamples Add the object-fit-{value} class to the replaced element:                html                                                                                      <img src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-contain border rounded\" alt=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-cover border rounded\" alt=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-fill border rounded\" alt=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-scale border rounded\" alt=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-none border rounded\" alt=\"...\">Responsive Responsive variations also exist for each object-fit value using the format .object-fit-{breakpoint}-{value}, for the following breakpoint abbreviations: sm, md, lg, xl, and xxl. Classes can be combined for various effects as you need.                html                                                                                      <img src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-sm-contain border rounded\" alt=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-md-contain border rounded\" alt=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-lg-contain border rounded\" alt=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-xl-contain border rounded\" alt=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-xxl-contain border rounded\" alt=\"...\">Video The .object-fit-{value} and responsive .object-fit-{breakpoint}-{value} utilities also work on <video> elements.<video src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-contain\" autoplay></video><video src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-cover\" autoplay></video><video src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-fill\" autoplay></video><video src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-scale\" autoplay></video><video src=\"...\" class=\"object-fit-none\" autoplay></video>CSS Sass utilities API Object fit utilities are declared in our utilities API in scss/_utilities.scss.
