On this page                                On this page                                      Changing display    Flexbox options    Margin and padding    Toggle visibility                                    Changing display Use our display utilities for responsively toggling common values of the display property. Mix it with our grid system, content, or components to show or hide them across specific viewports.Flexbox options Bootstrap is built with flexbox, but not every element\u2019s display has been changed to display: flex as this would add many unnecessary overrides and unexpectedly change key browser behaviors. Most of our components are built with flexbox enabled.Should you need to add display: flex to an element, do so with .d-flex or one of the responsive variants (e.g., .d-sm-flex). You\u2019ll need this class or display value to allow the use of our extra flexbox utilities for sizing, alignment, spacing, and more.Margin and padding Use the margin and padding spacing utilities to control how elements and components are spaced and sized. Bootstrap includes a six-level scale for spacing utilities, based on a 1rem value default $spacer variable. Choose values for all viewports (e.g., .me-3 for margin-right: 1rem in LTR), or pick responsive variants to target specific viewports (e.g., .me-md-3 for margin-right: 1rem \u2014in LTR\u2014 starting at the md breakpoint).Toggle visibility When toggling display isn\u2019t needed, you can toggle the visibility of an element with our visibility utilities. Invisible elements will still affect the layout of the page, but are visually hidden from visitors."
