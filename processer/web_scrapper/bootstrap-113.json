On this page                                On this page                                      Setup    Project structure    Configure Vite    Import Bootstrap                                    Want to skip to the end? Download the source code and working demo for this guide from the twbs/examples repository. You can also open the example in StackBlitz for live editing.Setup We\u2019re building a Vite project with Bootstrap from scratch, so there are some prerequisites and upfront steps before we can really get started. This guide requires you to have Node.js installed and some familiarity with the terminal.Create a project folder and set up npm. We\u2019ll create the my-project folder and initialize npm with the -y argument to avoid it asking us all the interactive questions.mkdir my-project && cd my-projectnpm init -yInstall Vite. Unlike our Webpack guide, there\u2019s only a single build tool dependency here. We use --save-dev to signal that this dependency is only for development use and not for production.npm i --save-dev viteInstall Bootstrap. Now we can install Bootstrap. We\u2019ll also install Popper since our dropdowns, popovers, and tooltips depend on it for their positioning. If you don\u2019t plan on using those components, you can omit Popper here.npm i --save bootstrap @popperjs/coreInstall additional dependency. In addition to Vite and Bootstrap, we need another dependency (Sass) to properly import and bundle Bootstrap\u2019s CSS.npm i --save-dev sassNow that we have all the necessary dependencies installed and set up, we can get to work creating the project files and importing Bootstrap.Project structure We\u2019ve already created the my-project folder and initialized npm. Now we\u2019ll also create our src folder, stylesheet, and JavaScript file to round out the project structure. Run the following from my-project, or manually create the folder and file structure shown below.mkdir {src,src/js,src/scss}touch src/index.html src/js/main.js src/scss/styles.scss vite.config.jsWhen you\u2019re done, your complete project should look like this:my-project/\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 js/\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.js\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 scss/\u2502   |   \u2514\u2500\u2500 styles.scss|   \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.html\u251c\u2500\u2500 package-lock.json\u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json\u2514\u2500\u2500 vite.config.jsAt this point, everything is in the right place, but Vite won\u2019t work because we haven\u2019t filled in our vite.config.js yet.Configure Vite With dependencies installed and our project folder ready for us to start coding, we can now configure Vite and run our project locally.Open vite.config.js in your editor. Since it\u2019s blank, we\u2019ll need to add some boilerplate config to it so we can start our server. This part of the config tells Vite where to look for our project\u2019s JavaScript and how the development server should behave (pulling from the src folder with hot reload).import { resolve } from 'path'export default {  root: resolve(__dirname, 'src'),  build: {    outDir: '../dist'  },  server: {    port: 8080  }}Next we fill in src/index.html. This is the HTML page Vite will load in the browser to utilize the bundled CSS and JS we\u2019ll add to it in later steps.<!doctype html><html lang=\"en\">  <head>    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">    <title>Bootstrap w/ Vite</title>    <script type=\"module\" src=\"./js/main.js\"></script>  </head>  <body>    <div class=\"container py-4 px-3 mx-auto\">      <h1>Hello, Bootstrap and Vite!</h1>      <button class=\"btn btn-primary\">Primary button</button>    </div>  </body></html>We\u2019re including a little bit of Bootstrap styling here with the div class=\"container\" and <button> so that we see when Bootstrap\u2019s CSS is loaded by Vite.Now we need an npm script to run Vite. Open package.json and add the start script shown below (you should already have the test script). We\u2019ll use this script to start our local Vite dev server.{  // ...  \"scripts\": {    \"start\": \"vite\",    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"  },  // ...}And finally, we can start Vite. From the my-project folder in your terminal, run that newly added npm script:npm startIn the next and final section to this guide, we\u2019ll import all of Bootstrap\u2019s CSS and JavaScript.Import Bootstrap Import Bootstrap\u2019s CSS. Add the following to src/scss/styles.scss to import all of Bootstrap\u2019s source Sass.// Import all of Bootstrap's CSS@import \"bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";You can also import our stylesheets individually if you want. Read our Sass import docs for details.Next we load the CSS and import Bootstrap\u2019s JavaScript. Add the following to src/js/main.js to load the CSS and import all of Bootstrap\u2019s JS. Popper will be imported automatically through Bootstrap.// Import our custom CSSimport '../scss/styles.scss'// Import all of Bootstrap's JSimport * as bootstrap from 'bootstrap'You can also import JavaScript plugins individually as needed to keep bundle sizes down:import Alert from 'bootstrap/js/dist/alert';// or, specify which plugins you need:import { Tooltip, Toast, Popover } from 'bootstrap';Read our JavaScript docs for more information on how to use Bootstrap\u2019s plugins.And you\u2019re done! \ud83c\udf89 With Bootstrap\u2019s source Sass and JS fully loaded, your local development server should now look like this:Now you can start adding any Bootstrap components you want to use. Be sure to check out the complete Vite example project for how to include additional custom Sass and optimize your build by importing only the parts of Bootstrap\u2019s CSS and JS that you need.See something wrong or out of date here?
